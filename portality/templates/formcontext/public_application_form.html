<h2>Journal Application Form</h2>

<p>If you know of a peer-reviewed journal that should be included in DOAJ, please ask its publisher or editor to complete this form.</p>

<p>We provide some <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.faq', _anchor='procedure') }}">guidance on the information we are looking for</a> but
that list is by no means exhaustive. Applicants are encouraged to complete the form clearly and honestly. If you
do not understand a question, you can ask for help by contacting us.</p>

<p>It is not possible to save your progress or for us to send you a confirmation email (although we will show you a confirmation 
    screen if the application has been submitted successfully) so, we recommend you gather the information you need first. We have
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.faq', _anchor='application') }}">created a spreadsheet guide of the form</a>, and provided some other
tips, to help you. Guides are also available in <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.translated') }}">
are available in other languages (العربية, 中文, فارسی, français, Bahasa Indonesia, Italiano, Polski, Português, Română, Русский, 
    Español, Türkçe, Українська)</a>.</p>
